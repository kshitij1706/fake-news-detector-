## ✅ What this README achieves:
- Looks **professional** and **recruiter-friendly**.
- Highlights **your skills** (ML, DL, Streamlit, APIs, etc.).
- Makes your repo **resume-ready**.
- Future-proofs the project by **hiding secrets**.

Do you also want me to create a **polished project screenshot** and **add it to the README**?  
It’ll make the repo **stand out even more** to recruiters. Should I?
